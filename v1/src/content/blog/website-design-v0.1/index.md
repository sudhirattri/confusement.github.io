## First update to website and why its not from scratch

Previously, I said many things which I do not stand by anymore in last post about designing a website.
I would like to rectify my mistakes and change my preference from designing everything from scratch to finally using a template.
I have used the [bevy website](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy-website) project as a template for [zola](https://www.getzola.org) 
static website generator.
<!-- more -->
I would continue to modify the css content to theme the website accordingly, but I feel satisfied by the organization and tidiness of the zola framework and will stick with it for indefinite time.
